# Hario Tetsuo 4-6 300g

- 18g medium coarse
- pour circular, center outward
- Bloom 45g
- 45s , 120g
- 1:30s, 180g
- 2:15s, 240g
- 2:45s, 300g
- Wait to 4m

# Hario Tetsuo 4-6 500g

- 30g medium coarse
- pour circular, center outward
- Bloom 75g
- 45s , 200g
- 1:30s, 300g
- 2:15s, 400g
- 2:45s, 500g
- Wait to 4m

# Osmotic flow

- 1:13 Ratio (20g coffee, 260g of 80C/176F water)
- Grind size 900-1300 microns (bit coarser than normal V60 grind, reference at 0:50)
- Rinse/pre-heat filter & shake coffee grinds flat in V60
- 0:00-0:15 Bloom with 3x (math works it to be 2.5x) grind dose in slow spirals about 1" high (60g)
- Wait 10 seconds
- 0:25-0:40 Slowly pour into center, very close to bed. Don't move kettle. Up to 120g
- Wait 5 seconds
- 0:45-2:15 Pour as slowly as possible, moving in circular motion, up to about 1" in diameter.
- Let drain for only 5 seconds, then remove brewer
- Stir

Notes:

- Using a smaller brewer (01 VS 02) helps, with a minimum 20g coffee dose
- Tip kettle on its side as you pour to be able to pour even slower (use cloth on bottom of kettle to hold it)

# hoffman 1 cup

1 Cup V60 Technique
15g Ground Coffee, 250g Water, or 18 and 300.

- Try to use best possible quality of water
- Try to use water as hot as possible after boiling, if light roast
- Use swirling motion, aim for 5g/sec Pour rate
- Try to keep spout close to surface

1. Preheat and Rinse (Plastic) Brewer and Filter with Hot tap water (Hot to Touch)
2. Dig a mound in the middle of the Ground Coffee
3. Zero/Reset Scale with Brewer and Ground Coffee
4. Boil Water

- 0:00 : Approx. ~50g Bloom Pour
- 0:10 - 0:15 : Gentle Swirl
- 0:00 - 0:45 : Bloom
- 0:45 - 1:00 : Pour to ~100g Total
- 1:00 - 1:10 : Pause
- 1:10 - 1:20 : Pour to ~150g Total
- 1:20 - 1:30 : Pause
- 1:30 - 1:40 : Pour to ~200g Total
- 1:40 - 1:50 : Pause
- 1:50 - 2:00 : Pour to ~250g Total
- 2:00 : Gentle Swirl, Wait for drawdown to Complete

Total Brew Time: Approx. ~3:00, YMMV; Adjust Grind if necessary for Taste/Time

Too Fast/Acidic = Finer

Too Slow/Bitter = Coarser

# Hot coffee v60

- Grind 30 g of coffee
- Rinse paper filter with water just off the boil
- Add coffee grounds to V60
- Create well in the middle of the grounds
- Start timer
- t = 0:00
- Add 2x coffee weight = 60 g of bloom water
- Swirl the coffee slurry until evenly mixed
- Bloom for up to 45 s
- t = 0:45
- Add water aiming for 60% of total brew weight = 300 g in the next 30 s
- Since you already added 60 g bloom water, add 240 g in 30 s (flow rate = 8 g/s)
- t = 1:15
- Add water aiming for 100% of the total brew weight = 500 g in the next 30 s
- Since you already added 300 g water, add 200 g in 30 s (flow rate = 6.66 g/s)
  Poor a little slower than in the first phase, not too aggressively
- t = 1:45
- Stir 1x clockwise and 1x anticlockwise with spoon. This knocks off grounds from side wall
- Allow V60 to drain a little
- Give V60 a gentle swirl
- Let brew drawdown. Aim to finish drawdawn by t = 3:30
- Enjoy!
