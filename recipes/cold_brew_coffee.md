# Hot coffee v60

- Grind 30 g of coffee
- Rinse paper filter with water just off the boil
- Add coffee grounds to V60
- Create well in the middle of the grounds
- Start timer
- t = 0:00
- Add 2x coffee weight = 60 g of bloom water
- Swirl the coffee slurry until evenly mixed
- Bloom for up to 45 s
- t = 0:45
- Add water aiming for 60% of total brew weight = 300 g in the next 30 s
- Since you already added 60 g bloom water, add 240 g in 30 s (flow rate = 8 g/s)
- t = 1:15
- Add water aiming for 100% of the total brew weight = 500 g in the next 30 s
- Since you already added 300 g water, add 200 g in 30 s (flow rate = 6.66 g/s)
  Poor a little slower than in the first phase, not too aggressively
- t = 1:45
- Stir 1x clockwise and 1x anticlockwise with spoon. This knocks off grounds from side wall
- Allow V60 to drain a little
- Give V60 a gentle swirl
- Let brew drawdown. Aim to finish drawdawn by t = 3:30
- Enjoy!
